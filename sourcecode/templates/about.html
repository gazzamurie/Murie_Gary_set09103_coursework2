Bob Cutlass: Welcome back to the Dinoco 400. I'm Bob Cutlass, here with my good friend, Darrel Cartrip. We're midway through what may turn out to be a  historic day for racing.
Darrel Cartrip: Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof right now. If this gets more exciting, they're gonna have to tow me outta the booth!
Bob Cutlass: Right you are, Darrell. Three cars are tied for the season points lead, heading into the final race of the season. And the winner of this race Darrell, will win the season title and, the Piston Cup. Does The King, Strip Weathers, have one more victory in him before retirement?
Darrell: He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years! Can he win them one last Piston Cup?
Bob: And, as always, in the second place spot we find Chick Hicks. He's been chasing that tailfin his entire career.
Darrell: Chick thought this was his year, Bob. His chance to finally emerge from The King's shadow. But the last thing he expected was...Lightning McQueen!
Bob: You know, I don't think anybody expected this. The rookie sensation come into the season unknown. But everyone knows him now.
Darrell: Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?
Bob: The legend, the runner up, and the rookie! Three cars, one champion!

Darrell: Trouble, turn three!
Chick: Haha. Get through that, Mcqueen.
Bob: Ouw.. A huge crash behind the leaders!
Fans: Wahh!!
Bob: Wait a second, Darrell. McQueen is in the wreckage.
Darrell: There's no way the rookie can make it through! Not in one piece that is.
Mia & Tia: Lightning, ahhh.
Darrell: Look at that, McQueen made it through!
Bob: Man, a spectacular move by Lightning McQueen.
McQueen: Yeah! Ka-chow!
Fans: McQueen (7X)
Fan: Yeah McQueen! Ka-chow!
Bob: While everyone else heads into the pits, McQueen stays out to take the lead!
Broken car: Don't take me out coach. I can still race!
Chick: Haha. What do you think boys? A thing of beauty.
Chick's coach: McQueen made it through!
Chick: What?
Chick's coach: He's not pitting!
Chick: Come on! Get me out there! Let's go! Get me back out there! Come on!
Bob: McQueen's not going into the pits!
Darrell: You know the rookie just fired his crew chief. That's the third one this season!
Bob: Well he says he likes working alone Darrell.
Chick's coach: Go, go, go!
Bob: Looks like Chick got caught up in the pits.
Darrell: Yeah, after a stop like that, he's got a lot of ground to make up.Get ready boys, we're coming to the restart!
Chick: Come on, come on, come on!
McQueen's crew: We need tires now! Come on, let's go!
McQueen: No,no,no,no! No tires, just gas!
McQueen's crew: What! You need tires, you idiot!
Darrell: Looks like it's all gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
Bob: That's right. No tires again.
Darrell: Normally I said a short-term gain, long-term loss, but it's sure is workin' for him. He obviously knows somethin' we don't know.
Bob: This is it Darrell, one lap to go and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
Darrell: All he's got it in the bag. Call in the dogs and put out the fire! We're gonna crown us a new champion!
McQueen: Checkered flag, here I come!
Darrell: Oh, no! McQueen has blown a tire!
Bob: And with only one turn to go! Can he make it?
McQueen's crew: You fool!
The King's Coach: McQueen's blown a tire!, McQueen's blown a tire! Go,go,go!
Darrell: He lost another tire! The King and Chick are coming up fast!
Bob: They're entering turn three!
McQueen: Come on.
Darrell: I don't belive what I'm watching, Bob!
Darrell: Lightning McQueen is hundred feet from his Piston Cup!
Bob: The King and Chick rounding turn four.
Darrell: Down the stretch they come! And it's, and it's...
Bob: It's too close to call! Too close to call!
Darrell: I don't belive it! (2X)
Mia & Tia: Lightning!
Bob: The most spectacular, amazing unequivocally, unbelievable ending in the history of the world! And we don't even know who won!
Darrell: Look at that!
Security: Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!
Kori Turbowitz: We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the race results. McQueen that was quite a risky move, not taking tires.
McQueen crew: Tell me about it.
Kori Turbowitz: Are you sorry you don't have a crew chief out there?
McQueen's Crew: Hah!
McQueen: Oh Kori. There's a lot more to racing than just winning. I mean, taking the race by a full lap... Where's the entertainment in that? No no no... I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.
McQueen's crew: Sizzle?
McQueen: Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief? No, I'm not. Cause I'm a one-man show.
McQueen crew: Whats? Oh, yeah right.
Kori Turbowitz: That was a very confident Lightning McQueen. Coming to you live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz.
Cameramen: Hey, get out of the shot!
McQueen: Yo, Chuck, what are you doing? You're blocking the camera. Everyone wants to see the bolt.
McQuenn crew: What?
McQueen: Now, back away.
McQueen's crew: Ahh! That's it. Come on guys.
McQueen: Whoa, team! Where are going?
McQueen's crew: We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!
McQueen: Oh, OK, leave. Fine. Hahaha. How will I ever find anyone else who knows how to fill me up with gas? Adios Chuck!
McQueen's crew: And my name is not Chuck!
McQueen: Oh, whatever.
Chuck: Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen! Seriously, that was some pretty darn nice racin' out there. By me! Hahaha!
Chick's crew: Zinger
Chick: Welcome to the Chick era, baby! The Piston Cup... It's mine dude. It's mine. Hey fellas, how do you think I'm look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue! Hahaha!
McQueen: In your dreams Thunder.
Chick: Yeah, right. Thunder? What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?
McQueen: You know, cause' thunder always comes after lightning. Pew, Kaka-phow!
Chick: Who here knew about the thunder thing?
Chick's crew: I didn't.
Cameramen: Give us the bolt!
Cameramen: That's right.
Cameramen: Right in the lens.
Cameramen: Show me the bolt, baby!
Cameramen: Smile, McQueen!
Cameramen: Show me the bolt, McQueen!
Cameramen: That's it!
Tex: Ohh we, that was one close finish. You sure made Dinoco proud. Thank you, King.

Dear: Whatever happens, you're winner to me, you old daddy rabbit.
The King: Thanks, dear. We wouldn't be nothing without you.
Mia: I'm Mia.
Tia: I'm Tia.
Mia & Tia: We're like your biggest fans! Ka-chow!
McQueen: I love being me.
Security: OK, girls, that's it.
Mia & Tia: We love you, Lightning!
Some guys far away: We love you more!!
The King: Hey, buddy. You're one gutsy racer.
McQueen: Oh, hey, Mr. The King.
The King: You got more talent in one lug nut than a lot of cars has got in their whole body.
McQueen: Really? Oh, that...
The King: But you're stupid.
McQueen: Excuse me?
The King: This ain't a one-man deal, kid. You need to wise-up and get you self a good crew chief and a good team. And you ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you, and you let them do their job, like they should. Like I tell the boys at the shop...
McQueen: A good team. Yeahhh.
Dreaming Song.
Mia & Tia: Oh, McQueen.
The King: If you figure that out, you just gonna be OK.
McQueen: Oh, yeah, that.. That is spectacular advice. Thank you Mr. The King.

Rust-eze Car: Hahaha. I met this car from Swampscott. He was so rusty he didn't even cast a shadow.
Rust-eze Van: You could see his dirty undercarriage. Hahaha.
McQueen: Uahh! I hate rusty cars. This is not good for my image.
Mack: They did give you your big break. Besides, it's in your contract.
McQueen: Oh, will you stop please? Just go get hooked up.

McQueen: Thanks, Harv.
Harv: Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets for the tiebreaker thing in Cali. I'll pass 'em on to your friends. You shoot me the names. You let Harv rock it for you. All right, baby?

Sally: What the...? Auww! Please!
McQueen: I know, I get that reaction a lot. I create feelings in others that they themselves don't understand.
Sally: Ohhh, auww!
McQueen: Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?
Mater: Well, a little bit, but I'll be alright.
Sally: OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
McQueen: Do what you gotta do, baby. Oh, but listen. Be careful. Folks around here are not firing on all cylinders, if you know what I mean.
Mater: Ka-ching! Auww!
Sally: I'll keep that in mind. Hey there, Mater.
Mater: Howdy, Sally.
Sally: Hi, folks!
Folks: Good morning! Sally.
McQueen: You know her?
Mater: She's the town attorney and my fiancee.
McQueen: What?
Mater: Nah, I'm just kiddin'. She just like me for my body.
Sally: Doc, you look great this morning. Did you do something different with your side view mirrors?
Doc: What do you want, Sally?
Sally: Ah, come on, make this guy fix the road. The town needs this.
Doc: No. I know his type. Racecar. That's the last thing this town needs.
Sally: OK, I didn't want to have to do this, Doc, but you leave me no choice. Fellow citizens, you're all aware of our town's proud history.
Doc: Here she goes again.
Sally: Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel strung on the necklage of Route 66, the mother road! It is our job and our pleasure to take care of the travelers on our stretch of that road.
Sarge: Travelers? What travelers?
Filmore: Ignore him.
Sally: But how, I ask you, are we to care for those travelers if there is no road for them to drive on? Luigi, what do you have at your store?
Luigi: Tires
Sally: And if no one can get to you?
Luigi: I won't sell any...tires. I will lose everything! Ohho.
Sally: Flo, what do you have at your store?
Flo: I have gas. Lotsa gas!
Sally: OK boys, stay with me. And, and, Flo, what'll happen if no one can come to your station to buy gas?
Flo: I'll go outta business and... we'll have to leave town.
Sally: And what's gonna happen to all of us if Flo leaves town and closes her station?
Folks: Without gas, we're done for!
Lizzie: What?
Sally: So, don't you think the car responsible should fix our road?
Lizzie: The only guy strong enough to fix that road is Big Al!
Ramone: Lizzie, the guy left, like, 15 years ago.
Lizzie: Then why are you bringing him up, you lemon?
Sally: Oh, he can do it. He's got the horsepower. So, what do you want him  to do?
Folks: Fix the road!
Sally: Because we are a town worth fixing!
Folks: Yeah!!!
Doc: Order in the court! Seems like my mind has been changed for me.
Folks: Yeah!!
McQueen: No!
Filmore: Nice rulin'.
McQueen: Ohh, I am so not take you to dinner.
Sally: That's OK, Stickers. You can take Bessie.
Mater: Oh man, you got to work with Bessie! I'd give my left two lug nuts for somethin' like that.
McQueen: Bessie? Who's Bessie?
Doc: This here is Bessie, finest road-pavin' machine ever built. I'm hereby sentencing you to community service. You're gonna fix the road under my supervision.
McQueen: What? This place is crazy!
Mater: Hey, I know this may be a bad time right now, but tha, you owe me $32,000 in legal fees.
McQueen: What?
Doc: So we're gonna hitch you up to sweet Bessie, and you're gonna pull her nice.
McQueen: You're gotta be kidding me.
Doc: You start there where the road begins, you finish down there where the road ends.
Mater: Holy shoot!
McQueen: Whoa, whoa, whoa! How long is this gonna take?
Doc: Well, fella does it right, should take him about five days.
McQueen: Five days? But I should be in California schmoozing Dinoco right now!
Doc: Then if I were you, I'd quit yappin and start workin'! Hook him up, Mater.
Mater: Okay-dokey.
McQueen: Freedom!!
Mater: Maybe I should've-a hooked him up to Bessie...and then-a...then took the boot off.
McQueen: Wuuuhuuu! Goodbye, Radiator Springs, and goodbye, Bessie! California, here I come! Yeah! Oh, fell that wind. Yes! No,no,no,no! Outta gas? How can I be outta gas?
Sheriff: Hahaha. Boy, we ain't as dumb as you think we are.
McQueen: But,but,but how did, how did...you...?
Sally: We siphoned your gas while you were passed out. Ka-chow.
McQueen: Auw,auw,auw,auw,auwww!!
Sheriff: Hahaha.
Sheriff: Gentlemen.
Sarge: Sheriff.
Filmore: Hai, Sheriff.
Luigi: Why the tires are here?
Guido: Sono sempre stati qui.
Luigi: They were better well before.
Guido: Stai sempre a parlare.
Luigi: Guido!
Lizzie: Red, can you move over? I want to get look at that sexy hot rod.
Mater: You know, I used to be a purty good whistler. I can't do it now of course, on account of sometimes I get fluid built up in my engine block, but Doc said he's gonna fix it dough. He can fix about anything. That's why we made him the judge. Boy, you shoulda heard me on Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow. Now, I'm not one to brag, but people come purty far to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".
McQueen: Ah? Ah, man, that's just great!
Mater: Hey, what's wrong?
McQueen: My lucky sticker's all dirty.
Mater: Thaah, that ain't nothin'. I'll clean it for ya.
McQueen: No,no,no! That wouldn't be necessary. Hey! Hey, big fella! Yeah, you in the red! I could use a little hose down. Help me wash this off. What, where's he goin'?
Mater: Oh, he's still a little bit shy, and he hates you for killin' his flowers.
McQueen: I shouldn't have to put up with this. I'm a precision instrument of speed and aerodynamics.
Mater: You hurt your what?
McQueen: I'm a very famous racecar!
Luigi: You are a famous racecar? A real racecar?
McQueen: Yes, I'm a real racecar. What do you think? Look at me.
Luigi: I have followed racing my entire life of my whole life!
McQueen: Then you know who I am. I'm Lightning McQueen.
Luigi: Lightening McQueen!
McQueen: Yes! Yes!
Luigi: I must scream it to the world! My excitement from the top of someplace very high! Do you know many Ferraris?
McQueen: No,no,no. They race on the European circuit. I'm in the Piston Cup! What?
Luigi: Luigi follow only the Ferraris.
Flo: Is that what I think it is?
Sally: Customers. Customers! Customers, everyone! Customers! OK.
Lizzie: Customers?
Sally: All right, everybody calm down for a long time. Just remember what we rehearsed. Make sure your "Open, please come in" signs are out. And you all know what to do. All right, nobody panics. Here we go!
Minny: Van, I just don't see any on-ramp anywhere.
Van: Minny, I know exactly where we are.

Van: We don't need anything, thank you very much.
Minny: Whoa, honey ask her direction to the Interstate.
Van: There's no need to ask for directions. Minny, I know exactly where we're going.
Minny: He did the same thing on our trip to Shakopee. You know, we were headed over there for the Crazy Days, and we...
Van: OK,OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
Filmore: What you really need is the sweet taste of my homemade, organic fuel.
Van: No, it doesn't agree with my tank.
Minny: We're just trying to find the Interstate.
Sarge: Good to see you, Soldier! Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut for all your government surplus needs.
Minny: Ohh, honey, surplus!
Van: I think we have too much surplus.
Sally: I do have a map over the Cozy Cone Motel. And if you do stay, we offer a free Lincoln Continental breakfast.
Minny: Honey, she's got a map.
Van: I don't need a map! I have the GPS. Never need a map again, thank you.
Flo: How 'bout somethin' to drink? Stop at Flo's V8 Cafe. Finest fuel on Route 66.
Van: No, we just top off.
Luigi: And if you need tires, stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires, home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.
Minny: We're just trying to find the Interstate.
Ramone: But you do need a paint job man. Ramone will paint you up right. Hey, anything you want! You know, like a flame job.
Minny: No, thanks...
Ramone: Maybe ghost flames! You like old school pinstripin'? Von Dutch style ha?
Minny: Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.
Van: Oh, ho, OK, no. Ahahaha. We're gonna be going now, OK? Auww!
Lizzie: A little somethin' to remember us by, OK?
Van: Oh,ha,ha. OK!
Sally: Come back soon, OK? I mean, you know where we are! Tell your friends!
Van: HohohOK! Yes. You bet.
Minny: Thanks again, folks. Bye-bye now.
McQueen: Psst! Psst! Hey! Hey, hey,hey! I know how to get to the Interstate!
Minny: Oh, do ya?
Van: Minny, no.
McQueen: Yeah, yeah,yeah. No, not really. But listen. I'm Lightning McQueen, the famous racecar. I'm being held heren against my will. And I need you to call my team, so they can rescue me, and get me to California in time for me to win The Piston Cup. Do you understand?
McQueen: No,no,no,no,no. No, It's the truth! I'm telling you! You gotta help me! Don't leave me here! I'm in hillbilly hell! My IQ's dropping by the second! I'm becoming one of them!
Sally: OK, don't worry. They know where we are now. They're gonna tell their friends. You'll see.
Radio: And we'll be back for our Hank Williams marathon...
Sally: That's good.
Radio:...after a Piston Cup update. Still no sign of Lightning McQueen. Meanwhile, Chick Hicks arrived in California and today became the first car to spend practice time on the track.
Chick: Yeah, well it's just nice to get out here before the other competitors. You know, get a headstart. Gives me an edge.
Dreaming Song
Chick: Yeah.
Chick: Hey, McQueen... Eat your heart out.
McQueen: Mater, let me get this straight. I can go when this road is done. That's the deal, right?
Mater: That's what they done did said.
McQueen: OK. Outta my way. I got a road to finish.
Mater: He's done!
Doc: Done?
Mater: Ahmhm.
Doc: It's only been an hour.
McQueen: I'm done. Look, I'm finished. Just say thank you, and I'll be on my way. That's all I gotta say.
Mater: Weehoo! I'm the first one on the new road! Ahho! It rides purty smooth.
Sally: It looks awful!
McQueen: Well, it matches the rest of the town.
Sally: Ahh.
Red: Umph, huhuhuh.
Sally: Red. Who do you think you are?
McQueen: Look, Doc said when I finish, I could go. That was the deal.
Doc: The deal was you fix the road, not making it worse. Now, scrape it off! Start over again.
McQueen: Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.
Doc: Hohoho. Is that right? Then why don't we just have a little race? Me and you.
Sally: What?
McQueen: Hohoho. Me and you. Is that a joke?
Doc: If you win, you go and I fix the road. If I win, you do the road my way.
Sheriff: Doc, what're you doin'?
McQueen: Hahaha. I don't mean to be rude here Doc, but you probably go zero to sixty in like what? Three-point-five years?
Doc: Then I reckon you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
McQueen: You know what old timer? That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.
Sheriff: Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race. You will drive to Willy's Butte, go around Willy's Butte and come back. There will be no bumpin', no cheatin', no spittin', no bittin', no road rage, no maimin', no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin', no backstabbin', no road-hoggin' and no lollygaggin'.
McQueen: Speed. I'm speed. Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer.
Luigi: OhHohohoo. My friend Guido, he dream to give a real racecar a pit stop.
Guido: Pit stop.
McQueen: Aa, haha. The race is only one lap, guys. Uno lappo! Don't need any help. I work solo mio.
Luigi: Fine. Race your way.
McQueen: No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
Guido: OK.
Sheriff: Gentlemen. Start your engines!
Ramone: Hijole! Check that out!
Filmore: Whoa.
Flo: Emm, emm.
Sally: Great idea, Doc. Now the road will never get done.
Sheriff: Luigi.
Luigi: Hohoho. On your mark, get set. Uno for the money, due for the show, tre to get ready, and quattro to... I can't belive it. Go!! Hahaha.
Doc: Yehaa! Hahaha!
Sally: Yeah.
Luigi: Huh? Doc, the flag means go. Remember the flag. Here we go. Go.
Ramone: Uhh, Doc, what are you doing, man?
Doc: Oh, dear. It would seem I'm off to a poor start. Well, better late than never. Come on, Mater. Might need a little help.
Mater: Ahh, OK.
Doc: You got your tow cable?
Mater: Well, yeah. I always got my tow cable. Why?
Doc: Ohh, just in case.
McQueen: Ahh,auw,auw,auw,no,no,no,no,no!
Ramone: Oh, man! Auww!!
Filmore: Whoa. Bad trip, man.
Doc: Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac, or was that stingin' like a Beemer? I'm confused.
Mater: Eh,eh,eh.
Doc: You drive like you fix roads. Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater
McQueen: Ahhh!
Mater: I'm startin' to think he knowed you was gonna crash!
McQueen: Thank you, Mater. Thank you.
McQueen: I can make a little turn on dirt. You think? No. And now I'm a day behind. I'm never gonna get outta here!
Ramone: Hey, ese! You need a new paint job, man!
McQueen: No, thank you.
Filmore: How 'bout some organic fuel?
Sarge: That freak juice?
McQueen: Pass.
Flo: Whooh, watchin' him workin' is makin' me thirsty. Anybody else want somethin' to drink?
Mater: Nah, not me, Flo. I'm on one of them there special diets. I'm a precisional instrument of speed and aero-matics.
McQueen: "You race like you fix roads." I'll show him. I will show him!
McQueen: Great! I hate it! Hate, hate, hate, hate it!!
Doc: Haha. Music. Sweet music.
Sally: Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
McQueen: Radiator Springs, a happy place.
Bessie: Peckkk.
McQueen: Whoa, OK, Bessie you think that funny? Great! I'm talking to Bessie now! I'm talkin to Bessie!!
Mater: Hahaha.
Sally: Wow.
Mater: Mornin', Sally! Hey, look at this here fancy new road that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!
Sally: Yes! Amazing!
Ramone: Yeah!
Flo: Ohh, Ramone, Mama ain't seen you that low in years.
Ramone: I haven't seen a road like this in years.
Flo: Well, then let's cruise, baby.
Ramone: Low and slow.
Luigi: E Bellissima! It's beautiful! Guido, look, it's a like it was paved by angels. Ohhh.
Mater: Oh, I tell you what. I bet even the roads on the moon ain't this smooth.
Sally: Doc, look at this. Shoulda tossed him into the cactus a lot sooner, huh?
Doc: Well, he ain't finished yet. Still got a long way to go.
Luigi: Guido, look at Luigi! Hahaha. This is fantastico!
Sally: That looks like fun! Mater, I got dibs, next turn!
Lizzie: Hey, Luigi, this new road makes your place look like a dump.
Luigi: Ahhh, that crazy old devil woman. Ohh, ohh. She's right!
Sally: Ohh, ahh!
Luigi: Guido!
Doc: That punk actually did a good jab. Well, now... where the hack is he?
Doc: Sheriff! Is he makin' another run for it?
Sheriff: No,no. He ran outta asphalt in the middle of the night, asked me if he could come down here. All he's tryin' to do is make that there turn.
McQueen: No,no,no,no! Ohh, great. Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on.
Doc: Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's.
Doc: I'll keep an eye on him.
Sheriff: Well, thanks, Doc. I've been feelin' a quart low.
McQueen: Ahhhhh! Phuahh, thahh!
Doc: This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.
McQueen: Oh, great. What do you want? You hear to gloat?
Doc: You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard, break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle. Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips.
McQueen: So you're a judge, a doctor and a racing expert.
Doc: I'll put it simple. If you goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turnin' right.
McQueen: Ooo, right. That makes perfect sense. Turn right to go left. Yes! Thank you! Or should I say,"No thank you"? Because in Opposite World, maybe that really means, "Thank you"! Tuh, crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!
Doc: Ahhh.
McQueen: Turn right to go left. Oh. Whoa, auwwww. Oh, that... AUUUUUWWWWWW!!!
McQueen: Turn right to go left. Guess what. I tried it. You know what? This crazy thing happened... I went right!
Lizzie: You keep talkin' to yourself, people'll think you crazy.
McQueen: Thanks for the tip.
Lizzie: What? I wasn't talkin' to you.
Sally: Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
Guido: Che cosa?
Sally: It looks great! This is great!
Guido: Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.
Mater: Ummmph. Oh, lord. Hehehe.
Sheriff: Mater! I need you to watch the prisoner tonight.
Mater: Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute, what if he tries to run again?
Sheriff: Just let him run outta gas and tow him on back. But keep an eye on him.
Mater: Yes, sir!
McQueen: While I'm stuck here paving this stinkin' road, Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco. My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who's touching me?
Luigi: You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix. You make a such a nice new road. You come to my shop. Luigi take a good care of you. Eventhough you not a Ferrari. You buy four tires, I give you a full size spare absolutely free!
McQueen: Look, I get all my tires for free.
Luigi: Hohoho.. I like your style, eh? You drive the hard bargain. OK. Luigi make you a new deal. You buy one tire, I give you three for free!
Flo: Aaa... Would you look at that? Ramone, Ramone!
Ramone: Hm,hm,hm.
Luigi: Then Luigi make you a new deal
McQueen: No,no,no,no. Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.
Luigi: No,no,no,no,no. This is it. My last offer. You buy one tire, I give you seven-a snow tire for all free! Done. You interested, you call me. You know where I am.
McQueen: Fuuuhhh. Ahhhh. Stop! Let me...Tuhh, puahh!!
sally: Oh, Red, you missed a spot. See it right there? On the hood right there.
McQueen: No, no! Noooo!! Stop, stop! That cold!! Help! Please! Stop!
Sally: Thanks, Red.
McQueen: What was that for?
Sally: Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone or what?
McQueen: Huh?
Sally: And if you do, you gotta be clean. 'Cause even here in hillibilly hell we have standards.
McQueen: What,I...? I don't get it.
Sally: Nothing I just thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job. So I thought I'd let you stay with me. I mean, not with me! But there. Not with me there, but there in your own Cozy Cone. And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
McQueen: Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.
Sally: I mean if you want to stay at the dirty impound, thats, thats fine. You know, I understand you criminal types.
McQueen: No,no,no,no. That's OK. Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
Sally: Ehhh. It's newly refurbished
McQueen: Haha. Yeah, it's like a clever little twist the motel's made out of caution cones, which, of course, cars usually try to avoid, now we're gonna stay in them. Haha. That's funny.
Sally: Figure that all out on your own, did you? Cone number one, if you want.
McQueen: Auuhhh.
McQueen: Hey, do I spy a little pinstriping tattoo back there?
Sally: Auuww. Haha. That's just a... Ahhahaha. Auuww. You saw that? Yeah! Just gonna be going. Gonna...Yeah.
Mater: You know, I once knew this girl Doreen. Good-lookin' girl. Looked just like a Jaguar, only she was a truck! You know, I used to crash into her, just so I could spoke to her.
McQueen: What are you talking about?
Mater: I don't know. Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight, 'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!
McQueen: No, Mater, I gotta finish this road, and I have to get out of here.
Mater: Well, that's all right, Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt. You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
McQueen: Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater. You know who you're talkin' to? This is Lightning McQueen. I can handle anything.
McQueen: Mater, I'm not doin' this.
Mater: Oh, come on, you'll love it. Hehehe. Tractor-tippin's fun.
McQueen: This is ridiculous.
Mater: All right, listen. When I say go, we go. But don't let Frank catch ya. Go!
McQueen: Whoa! Wait! Who, who's Frank? Mater. Wait, Mater!
Mater: OK, here's what you do. You just sneak up in front of 'em, and then honk. And they do the rest. Watch this.
Mater: Hahahaha. I swear, tractors is so dumb! I tell you what, buddy, you don't get much better than this.
McQueen: Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.
Mater: I don't care who you are, that's funny right there. Oh, you turn, bud.
McQueen: Mater, I can't. I don't even have a horn.
Mater: Baby.
McQueen: I'm not a baby.
Mater: Puuuck, puck, puck.
McQueen: Fine. Stop! stop, OK? All right. I'll do something.
Mater & McQueen: Hahahahaha!!!
Mater: That's Frank.
McQueen: Ahhhh!!
Mater: Run, hahaha , run!!!
Mater: Run! He's gonna get ya! Hahaha!!
Sally: Customers!
Mater: Tomorrow night we can go look for the ghostlight!
McQueen: I can't wait, Mater.
Mater: Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya! Oh, boy, you gotta admit that was funnn unn!
McQueen: Oh, yeah...yeah.
Mater: Well, we better get you back to the impound lot.
McQueen: You know, actually, Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.
Mater: Aaaa... Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
McQueen: Oh, come...No. No, are you kidding? Besides, she can't stand me. And I don't like her, to be honest.
Mater: Yeah, you probably right. Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!
McQueen: Where, where?
Mater: Hahaha. You're in love with Miss Sally.
McQueen: No, I'm not.
Mater: Yes, you do.
McQueen: No way.
Mater: Way.
McQueen: Come on, look
Mater: You're in love with Miss Sally(2X)
McQueen: OK, that's real mature Mater, real grown up.
Mater: You love her (7X)
McQueen: Wait...All right. OK. Mater, Mater, Mater, no. Will you stop that?
Mater: Stop what?
McQueen: That's driving backwards stuff. It's creeping me out. You're gonna wreck on somethin'.
Mater: Wreck? Shoot! I'm the world's best backwards driver! You just watch this right here, lover boy.
McQueen: What are you doing? Watch out! Look out! Mater? Mater! Mater!
McQueen: Hey take it easy, Mater!
Mater: Waaaaaaa! Ha,ha,ha! Hee,hee.
McQueen: Hahaha. He's nuts.
Mater: No need to watch where I'm goin'. Just need to know where I've been.
McQueen: Whoa, that was incredible! How'd you do that?
Mater: Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some, and I'll teach you if you want.
McQueen: Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race.
Mater: What's so important about this race of yours, anyway?
McQueen: It's not just a race. We're talking about the Piston Cup! I've been dreaming about it my whole life! I'll be the first rookie in history ever to win it. And when I do, we're talkin' big new sponsor, with private helicopters. No more medicated bumper ointment. No more rusty old cars.
Mater: What's wrong with rusty old cars?
McQueen: Well, I don't mean you, Mater. I mean other old cars. You know? Not like you. I like you.
Mater: Nahhh, it's OK, buddy. Hey, you think maybe one day I can get a ride in one of them helicopters? I mean, I've always wanted to ride in one of them fancy helicopters.
McQueen: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
Mater: You mean it?
McQueen: Oh, yeah. Anything you say.
Mater: I knew it. I knowed I made a good choice!
McQueen: In what?
Mater: My best friend.
Mater: See you tomorrow, buddy! McQueen and Sally parked beneath a tree, K-I-S somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!!
McQueen: Hahaha! Whoa, whoa. Haha.
McQueen: Number one. Number one...Ahhh...Number one!
McQueen: Ahh, this is nice.
Sally: Hey, Stickers.
McQueen & Sally: Huh!!
Sally: I'm sorry.
McQueen: Wohho!! You scared me. You gotta be careful.
Sally: I scared myself scaring you scaring me.
McQueen: I mean, I wasn't like "scared" scared.
Sally: No, of course not. Not.
McQueen: I was more...
Sally: Just I overheard you talkin' to Mater.
McQueen: When? Just, just now? What, what did, what did you hear?
Sally: Oh, just something about a helicopter ride.
McQueen: Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got a kick out of that, didn't he?
Sally: Did you mean it?
McQueen: What?
Sally: That you'll get him a ride.
McQueen: Oh, who knows? I mean first things first. I gotta get outta here and make the race.
Sally: Ah, hah. You know...Mater trusts you.
McQueen: Yeah, OK.
Sally: Did you mean that?
McQueen: What?
Sally: Was it just a "Yeah, OK", or "Yeah...OK" or"Yea-yeah, OK"
McQueen: Look, I'm exhausted. It's kinda been a long day.
Sally: Yeah, OK. G'night.
McQueen: Oh ah. Hey, thank you.
Sally: What did you just say?
McQueen: You know, thanks for lettin' me stay here. It's nice to be out of the impund, and this is... It's great. Newly refurbished, right?
Sally: Yeah.
McQueen: Good night.
Sally: Good night.
Sally: Huhh.
Sarge: Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?
Filmore: Respect the classics, man. It's Hendrix!
McQueen: Ahh...huh...please...huh...
Dreaming Song
McQueen: No!!
Frank: Uarghhh!!
McQueen: Noooo!!! I gotta get outta here!
McQueen: Hey, have you seen the Sheriff? Oh! Oh, my gosh. Oh!
Doc: Hey, what are you doin'?
Sheriff: Get a good peak, city boy?
McQueen: I,a..a..I just need my daily gas ration from the Sheriff.
Doc: Wait for him at Flo's. Now get outta here.
McQueen: I've been trying to get outta here for three days!
Sheriff: Hope you enjoyed the show!
McQueen: Whoaho, Doc. Time to clean out the garage, buddy, come on.
McQueen: What? He has a Piston Cup?
McQueen: Oh, my gosh. Three Piston Cup?
Doc: Sign says stay out.
McQueen: You, you have three Piston Cups. How could you have...
Doc: I knew you couldn't drive. I didn't know you couldn't read.
McQueen: You're the Hudson Hornet!
Doc: Wait over at Flo's, like I told ya!
McQueen: Of course. I can't belive I didn't see it before. You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet! You still to hold the record for most wins in single season. Oh, we gotta talk. You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
Doc: I already tried that.
McQueen: And you won the championship three times! Look at those trophies!
Doc: You look. All I see is a bunch of empty cups.
Filmore: You know, some automotive yoga could really lower your RPM's, man.
Sarge: Oh, take a car wash, hippie.
Flo: Yeah, look at my husband, y'all. Hooo...That's your color!
Ramone: Yellow, baby. Hahaha.
Flo: Mmm! You smokin' hot!
Sheriff: There he is!
McQueen: Oh, my gosh! Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?
Folks: Hahahaha!
Sheriff: Doc? Our Doc?
Sarge: Not Doc Hudson.
McQueen: No,no,no,no, it's true! He's a real racing legend. He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
Flo: Fabulous? I never seen Doc drive more than 20 miles an hour. I mean, have you ever seen him race?
McQueen: No, but I wish I could have of. They say he was amazing! He wins three Piston Cups.
Mater: Phooah!! He did what in his cup?
Sheriff: I think the heat's startin' to get to the boy!
Lizzie: Well, I'll say! Look how red he is!
Ramone: Yeah, I think he needs a new coat of poly, man.
Mater: Are you sick, buddy?
Sheriff: You are lookin' a little peaked.
Ramone: Yeah, he needs a new coat of poly for sure!
Sheriff: Hey, hey! What are you doin'?
Sally: It's OK, Sheriff. You can trust me, right?
Sheriff: I trust you, all right. It's him I'm worried about.
Sally: Mmm... I trust him. Come on, let's take a drive.
McQueen: A drive?
Sally: Yeah, a drive. Don't you big city racecars ever just take a drive?
McQueen: Ahhh...No. No, we don't.
Sally: Hey, Stickers! Do you comin' or what?
Flo: Ahmm. And you thought he was gonna run.
Ramone: Hey, can you believe it, man? He actually thought Doc was a famous racecar! Hahaha... That's so too much!!
McQueen: OK, you got me out here. Where are we goin'?
Sally: I don't know.
McQueen: Whoa! Yes.
Sally: Hahaha.
McQueen: Whoa! Hahaha. Uahh!!
Sally: Hahaha.
McQueen: Thahhh!
Sally: Ah.. hahaha!
Sally: Ah.. hahaha!
McQueen: Hahaha! Thuhhh!!Thuhh!!
McQueen: Wow! What is this place?
Sally: Wheel Well. Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.
McQueen: This place?
Sally: Yeah, imagine...Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here.
McQueen: You know, I don't get you. How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?
Sally: Well, it's really pretty simple. I was...an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and.
McQueen: Oh, you were, were you? Were you rich?
Sally: What?
McQueen: Just...clues to the puzzle.
Sally: Yeah, OK. Well, that was my life. And you know what? It never felt...happy.
McQueen: Yeah. I mean...really?
Sally: Yeah. So I left California. Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here. Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in. Well, they all did. And I never left.
McQueen: Yeah. You know, I understand. You need a little R & R. Recharge and old batteries. But you know, after a while, why didn't you go back?
Sally: I fell in love.
McQueen: Ohh.
Sally: Yep.
McQueen: Corvette?
Sally: No.
Sally: I fell in love with this.
McQueen: Whoa. Look at that. Look, they're drivin' right by. They don't even know what they're missing!
Sally: Well, it didn't used to be that way.
McQueen: Oh, yeah?
Sally: Yeah. Forty years ago, that Interstate down there didn't exist.
McQueen: Really?
sally: Yeah. Back then, cars came across the country a whole different way.
McQueen: How do you mean?
Sally: Well, the road didn't cut through land like that Interstate. It moved with the land, you know? It rose, it fell, it curved.
Folk: Mornin'!
Folk: Nice day, huh?
Sally: Cars didn't drive on it to make a great time. They drove on it to have a great time.
Song
McQueen: Well, what happened?
Sally: The town got bypassed just to save ten minutes of driving.
Song
McQueen: How great would it have been to see this place in its heyday!
Sally: Ohh...I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that. But one of these days, we'll find a way to get it back on the map.
McQueen: Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive. I had a great time. It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while.
Sally: You're welcome.
Mater: Hey, listen, listen! If anybody asks you, we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?
McQueen: Wha... What?
Ramone: Oh, man, the paint's still wet!
Luigi: No,no,no,no! Get out of the store! Hey! Don't eat the radial! Here, take-a the snow tires.
Sheriff: Mater!
Mater: I wasn't tractor-tippin'!
Sheriff: Then where did all these gol-durn tractors come from?
Mater: Whoa, boy! Whoa!
McQueen: Hahaha. Hey! Hey guys. There's one goin' this way. I got it.
McQueen: Come here, little tractor, come here. Yeah, that's a good tractor. No,no,no,no, come here. What are you doing? You're not supposed to go wandering off all...alone.
McQueen: What are you doin' with those old racin' tires?
Doc: Huuhhh.
McQueen: Come on, Doc, drive.
Doc: Ahhhh. Yeah.
McQueen: Wow! You're amazing! What are you doin'? Doc, wait!
Mater: Giddup right in there! Come on, Rusty. Weee...heyy!
McQueen: Doc, hold it! Seriously, your driving's incredible!
Doc: Wonderful. Now, go away.
McQueen: Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!
Doc: I'm askin' you to leave.
McQueen: Come on. I'm a racecar, you're... a much older racecar, but under the hood you and I are the same.
Doc: We are not the same! Understand? Now, get out.
McQueen: How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?
Doc: You think I quit?
McQueen: Right. Your big wreck in '54.
Doc: They quit on me. When I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome. You know what they said? "You're history". Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line. There was a lot left in me. I never got chance to show 'em. I keep that, to remind me never to go back. I just never expected that that world would...would find me here.
McQueen: Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.
Doc: Oh, yeah?
McQueen: No, I'm not.
Doc: When is the last time you cared about something except yourself, hot rod? You name me one time. And I will take it all back. Ahhuh? I didn't think so. These are good folk around here, who care about one another. I don't want 'em depending on someone they can't count on.
McQueen: Oh, like you? You've been here how long and your friends don't even know who you are? Who's caring about only himself?
Doc: Just finish that road and get outta here!
sarge: Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?
Filmore: Respect the classics, man.
Mater: He's done. He must've finished it while we was all sleepin'.
Doc: Good riddance.
Flo: He's gone?
Sarge: Well, we wouldn't want him to miss that race of his.
Sheriff: Hisk...hisk.
Ramone: Oh, dude, are you crying?
Sheriff: No! I'm happy! I don't have to watch him every second of the day anymore! I'm glad he's gone!
Red: Hahaha.
McQueen: What's wrong with Red?
Mater: Oh, he's just sad 'cause you left town, and went to your big race to win the Piston Cup that you've always dreamed about your whole life and get that big ol' sponsor and that fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.
Mater: Huuhh! Wait a minute!
Folks: Hahaha.
Mater: I knowed you wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
McQueen: Hahaha.
Sheriff: What are you doin' here, son? You're gonna miss your race. Don't worry. I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up the time.
McQueen: Thank you, Sheriff. But you know I can't go just yet.
Sheriff: Well, why not?
McQueen: I'm not sure these tires...can get me all the way to California. Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens?
Luigi: Ah..haha! I can't-a believe it!
Luigi: Four new tires! Grazien, Mr. Lightning. Grazien!
Flo: Would you look at that!
Luigi: Our first real customers in years! I am filled with tears of ecstacy, for this is the most glorious day of my life!
McQueen: All right, Luigi, give me the best set of blackwalls you've got.
Luigi: No,no,no,no! You don't-a know what you want. Luigi know what you want. Blackwall tires. They blend into the pavement. But-a this...white-wall tires! They say, "Look at me! Here I am! Love me."
McQueen: All right, you're the expert.
Luigi: Eh, hehehee!
McQueen: Oh, and don't forget the spare.
Luigi: Perfetto. Guido!
Guido: Peet stop!
Song
Luigi: Hahaha! What did Luigi tell you, aey?
McQueen: Wow, you were right. Better than a Ferrari, huh?
Luigi: Aaa, No.
McQueen: Wow! This organic fuel is great! Why haven't I heard about it before?
Filmore: It's a conspiracy, man! The oil companies got a grip on the government! They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.
McQueen: OK, I'll take a case.
Ramone: Ahh.. Yeah. Ka-chow.
Mater: Here she comes!
McQueen: Places, everybody. Hurry! Act natural.
Folks: Hi, Sally.
Sally: All right, what's goin' on?
Mater: Ladies and gentlecars, please welcome the neeewww Lightning McQueen!
McQueen: What do you think? Radiator Springs looks pretty good on me.
Sally: I'll say. Rrr. Ka-chow. You're gonna fit right in in California. Oh my goodness. It looks like you've helped everybody in town.
McQueen: Yeah, everybody except one. Hey, is it getting dark out?
Lizzie: What? What'd he say?
McQueen: Let me say that again. Is it getting dark out?
Lizzie: Now, what was I supposed to do after that?
Song
Sally: They fixed their neon.
Flo: Low and slow?
Ramone: Oh, yeah, baby!
McQueen: Just like in its heyday, right?
Sally: It's even better than I pictured it. Thank you.
McQueen: Shall we cruise?
Lizzie: Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!
McQueen: No,no,no.
Sally: Lizzie!
Lizzie: I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him.
Mater: Hey, Miss sally. May I have this cruise?
Sally: Of course, Mater.
Sheriff: A,a,ah!
Lizzie: ...and again and I said, "No," and he asked me again, and I said, "No." But, oh, he was a persistent little burger for a two-cylinder. Finally I said, "All right, one little drive."
Mater: Hahaha.
McQueen: Hey!
Sally: Thanks, Mater.
Mater: Good evenin', you two.
Lizzie: Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this.
Flo: Is that what I think it is?
Sally: Oh, I don't know, Flo. I haven't had a chance to find out. But I am going to find out. Hello.
Flo: Not that. That.
Sally: Huh. Customers?
Flo: Customers, everybody! And a lot of 'em! You know what to do. Just like we rehearsed.
Mater: It's the ghostlight!
Helicopter: We have found McQueen. We have found McQueen!
Cameramen: McQueen, over here!
McQueen: Aaa, wait, excuse me.
Cameramen: Is it true you've been in rehab?
Cameramen: Did you have a nervous breakdown, McQueen.
McQueen: I'm sorry, what?
Cameramen: McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
Cameramen: Are the tires you wearing are turning balding?
Sally: Stickers, McQueen!
Cameramen: Was Lightning McQueen your prisoner?
Mater: Shoot, no! We're best buds! I ain't braggin' or nothin', but I was in charge of huntin' him down if he tried to escape.
McQueen: Sally, Sally!
Kori: McQueen! Will you still race for the Piston Cup?
Sally: Stickers?
McQueen: Sally!
Cameramen: Come on, give us some bolt!
Mack: You're here! Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!
McQueen: Mack?
Mack: You're here! I can't belive it! Oh, hoho. You are a sight for some headlights! I'm so sorry I lost you, boss. I'll make it up to you!
McQueen: Mack, I, I can't belive you're here.
Harv: Is that the world's fastest racing machine?
McQueen: Is that Harv?
Mack: Yeah. He's in the back.
Cameramen: Show us the bolt, McQueen!
Mack: Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!
Cameramen: Hey, where's the old McQueen?
Mack: Actually, this is my good side here.
Cameramen: Show us the bolt!
McQueen: Harv! Harv!
Cameramen: Give us the bolt!
McQueen: Harv?
Cameramen: Come on!
Harv: Kid, I'm over here!
McQueen: How you doin', buddy?
Harv: My star client disappears off the face of the earth! How do you think I'm doing?
McQueen: Harv, I can explain.
Harv: I'm doing great! You're everywhere, baby! Radio, TV, the papers! You can't buy this kind of publicity! What do you need me for? That's just a figure of speech, by the way. You signed a contract. Where are you? I can't even find you on my GPS.
McQueen: I'm in this little town called Radiator Springs. You know Route 66? It's still here!
Harv: Yeah, that's great, kid. Playtime is over, pal. While the world's been trying to find you, Dinoco has had no one to woo. Who are they gonna woo?
McQueen: Chick!
Harv: Bingo. In fact, check out what's on the plasma right now.
Cameramen: Show us the thunder!
Chick: You want thunder? You want thunder? Ka-chicka, ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
McQueen: Hey, that's my bit!
Harv: You've gotta get to Cali, pronto! Just get out of Radiation Stinks now, or Dinoco is history, you hear me?
McQueen: Just give me a second here, Harv.
Harv: No,no,no, wait. Where are goin'. Get in the trailer, baby. Kid! You want, you want a bigger trailer?
McQueen: Sally, I...I want you to... Look, I wish...Ahhhh.
Sally: Thank you. Thanks for everything.
McQueen: Ah. Haha. It just a road.
Sally: No. It was much more than that.
Mack: Hey, kid! We gotta go. Harv's goin' crazy! He's gonna have me fired if I don't get you in the truck right now!
McQueen: Mack, just... hold it for...
Sally: You should go.
McQueen: I know, but...
Sally: Good luck in California. I hope you find what you're looking for.
Cameramen: McQueen, come on!
McQueen: Sally!
Cameramen: Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt! Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!
Cameramen: Where's the old McQueen?
Harv: Come on, get in the trailer. That's it. That's right kid, let's go! You're a big shining star. You're a superstar. You don't belong there, anyway.
McQueen: Whoa... Wait...Whoa,whoa,wait,wait!
Cameramen: Hey, guys! McQueen's leavin' in the truck!
Kori: Hey, are you Doc Hudson?
Doc: Yeah.
Kori: Thanks for the call.
Sally: You called them?
Doc: It's best for everyone, Sally.
Sally: Best for everyone, or best for you?
Mater: I didn't get to say goodbye to him.
Bob: Hello, race fans, and welcome to what has become, quite simply, the biggest event in the history of racing. A three way battle for the Piston Cup!
Darrell: There's a crowd of nearly 200,000 cars here at the Los Angeles International Speedway. Tickets to this race are hotter than a black leather seat on a hot summer day!
Bob: The King, Chick Hicks and Lightning McQueen in a 200 laps, winner-takes-all, tiebreaker race.
Darrell: You know I got a lotta miles on me, but let me tell you somethin' buddy. I never thought I'd see anything like this. Wow! Man. This is exciting!
Bob: In fact, the country has almost shut down, to watch what many experts are calling "the race of the century."
Junior: Hey, King! Good luck in your last race. You've sure been an inspiration to me.
The King: Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.
Dear: Hey, be careful out there, OK?
The King: Yeah, mam.
Mia: He's hot.
Chick: Wanna know the forecast? I'll give you the forecast. A 100 percent chance of thunder! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Say it with me! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
Security: Hey, you! No admittance without a garage pass.
Fred: Oh, it's OK. Lightning McQueen knows me!
Andretti: Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day for a race, isn't it?
Security: Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
Andretti: And good morning to you, Fred.
Fred: Mario Andretti he knows my name! You gotta let me in now!
Security: Sorry, pal.
McQueen: OK, here we go. Focus. Speed. I am speed. Victory, one winner, two losers. Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...
Mack: Hey, Lightnin'! You ready?
McQueen: Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm...I'm ready.
McQueen: Mack, thanks for being my pit crew today.
Mack: Nahh. Don't worry about it, kid. It's the least I could do. After all, "Gas Can" is my middle name.
McQueen: It is?
Mack: Nahh, not really.
Small aeroplane: A. O.
TV Crew: Nelson! Zoom in. Ready, 16? Take 16.
Bob: And there he is, Lightning McQueen! Missing all week, and then he turns up in the middle of nowhere! In a little town called Radiator Springs.
Darrell: Wearin' whitewall tires, of all things.
Chick: Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Hahaha. Hey, where you been? I've been kinda lonely. Nobody to hang out with. I mean, except the Dinoco folks. Ohhh and the twins. Of course. You know the twins the one that used to be your fans, but now they're my fans. Anyway, listen to what the twins think...
McQueen: Ahh. Shoot!
Fans: Boogity, boogity, boogity, boys! Let's go racin'!
Dear: Come on, you can do it!
Tex: Come on kid, make us proud, boy!
Bob: Fifty laps down, and The King is still holding a slim lead.
Darrell: Hey, McQueen's got a run on him! He's lookin' to the inside! Ohh! Chick slammed the door on him!
Bob: Chick's not making it easy on him today.
Darrell: Oh, man, he lost so much momentum, and now he's gonna have to chase him back down!
Bob: Ohhh, McQueen spins out in the infield!
Chick: Hahaha! Just me and the old man, fellas. McQueen just doesn't have it today.
Mack: Hey, kid, are you all right?
McQueen: I don't know, Mack. I..I... I don't think I...
Doc: I didn't come all this way to see you quit.
McQueen: Doc?
Guys: Yey.. Hahaha.
McQueen: Guys, you're here! I can't believe this!
Doc: I knew you needed a crew chief, but I didn't know it was this bad.
McQueen: I thought you said you'd never come back.
Doc: Well, I really didn't have a choice. Mater didn't get to say goodbye.
Mater: Goodbye!! Okay, I'm good.
McQueen: Hahaha!
Doc: All right, if you can drive as good as you fix a road, then you can win this race with you eyes shut. Now, get back out there! Hot snot, we are back in business! Guido! Luigi! You're goin' up against professional pit crews boys, you're gonna have to be fast.
Luigi: They will not know what bit them!
Doc: Kid, you can beat these guys. Find a groove that works for you and get that lap back.
Chick's Crew: Is that?
Chick's Crew: Oh, wow. That's him!
TV Crew: Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet! Bob, Darrell! The Hudson Hornet's back!
Bob: Darrell, it appears McQueen has got himself a pit crew. And look who he has for a crew chief!
Fans: Wow... Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
Biggest fan: Whoa!!
Fans: Well, dip me in axle grease and call me Slick! It surely is.
Biggest fan: Hahahahaha!
Bob: Wow, this is history in the making. Nobody has seen the racing legend in over 50 years!
Lizzie: Hey, Doc! Come look at the fellow on the radio. He looks just like you.
Bob: McQueen passes them on the inside!
Darrell: But he's still nearly a lap fail.
Bob: Can he catch up to them with only 60 laps to go?
Doc: You're goin' great, kid. Just keep your head on.
Guido: Vai! Vai! Vai,vai!
Chick's crew: Hey, shrimpie, where did McQueen find you, huh? Those round things are called tires, and they go under the car!
All Chick's Crew: Hahahahaha!!!
Guido: Con chi credi di parlare? Ma, con chi stai parlando?
Luigi: No! No, no! You'll have your chance. You will have your chance.
Chick: Oh, kid's just tryin' to be a hero, huh? Well, what do you think of this? Yeah, that's it kid. Whats??
Mater: Whoa! Git-R-done! Hahaha! I taught him that. Ka-chow!
Chick Crew: Auuww!
Bob: What a move by McQueen! He's caught up to the leaders.
Darrell: Oh, yeah. This is what it's all about. A three-way battle for the lead, with ten to go.
Tex: Hahaha! Look at that boy go out there!
Chick: No, you don't.
McQueen: Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!
Doc: Can you get back to the pits?
McQueen: Yeah, yeah. I think so.
Doc: Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in. Don't tear yourself up, kid.
Mack: We gotta get him back out there fast or we're gonna be a lap down, and we'll never win this race!
Doc: Guido! It's time.
Chick Crew: Hey, tiny, you gonna clean his windshield? Hahaha!
Darrell: I don't believe it!
Bob: That was the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!
Darrell: It was a great stop, but he's still gotta beat that pace car out!
Bob: It's gonna be close.
Mater: Yeah!!
Biggest Fan: Yeah, baby!!
Fans: Yeah... Hahaha!
Darrell: Yeah!! He's back in the race!
Guido: Peet stop.
Luigi: Guido, you did it!
Mater: Way to go, Guido!
Ramone: Yeah!!
Bob: This is it. We're heading into the final lap and McQueen is right behind the leaders. What a comeback!
Darrell: A hundred and ninety-nine laps, and, baby, it all comes down to this!
Doc: This is it, kiddo. You've got four turns left. One at a time. Drive it in deep and hope it sticks. Go!
Chick: We'll see about that!
Bob: McQueen's going inside!
Bob: Chick and The King are loose!
Darrell: I think McQueen is out of the race!
Darrell: McQueen saved it!
Bob: He's back on the track!
Doc: Float like a Cadillac...
McQueen: Sting like a Beemer!
Biggest Fan: Ka-chow, ka-chow, ka-chow!
Fans: Wooowww!
Folks: Yeeehaaaa! Hahaha.
Darrell: Lightning McQueen is gonna win the Piston Cup!
Sally: Come on! You got it! You got it, Stickers!
Chick: I am not comin' in behind you again, old man.
Dear: Oh, no!
Chick: Yeah... Woooww! I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!
Flo: What's he up to, Doc?
The King: What are you doin', kid?
McQueen: I think The King should finish his last race.
The King: You just gave up the Piston Cup, you know that?
McQueen: Ahhh. This grumpy old racecar I know once told me somethin'. It's just an empty cup.
Bob: Darrell, is pushing on the last lap legal?
Darrell: Hey, man. He's not really pushin' him. He's just givin' him a little bump draft.
Chick: Whoaa.. Hohooo!! Hey. What? What's goin' on?
Fan: That's what I call racin' right there.
Tex: Hahaha!
Luigi: Bravo il mio amico!
Mater: Way to go, buddy!
Filmore: There's a lotta love out there, you know, man?
Sarge: Don't embarrass me, Filmore.
Lizzie: That's my hot rod.
Chick: Come on, baby, bring it out! Bring out the Piston Cup! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Yeah! Now, that's what I'm talkin' about! Hey, how come I'm the only one celebrating is me, huh? Where are the girls? Bring on the confetti! Auuww! Auuww! Easy with the confetti. What's goin' on? Come on, snap some pictures. I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco! Ka-chicka! Say it with me. Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
Cameramen: Booo!
Mia & Tia: Booo!
Chick: What's wrong with everybody? Where's the happiness? Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!
Dear: Thanks, Lightnin'.
McQueen: You're welcome.
Fan: Way to go, King!
Fan: You're still the car!
Biggest Fan: You're The King! Yeah!
Rust-eze Folks: Yeah! Hahahaha!
Mack: Wahh! Hoo!
Rust-eze Car: You make us proud, kid!
Mack: Congrats on the loss, me bucko!
Doc: You got a lotta of stuff, kid.
McQueen: Thanks, Doc.
Tex: Hey, Lightnin'. How 'bout comin' over here and talk to me a minute? Son, that was some real racin' out there. How'd you like to become the new face of Dinoco?
McQueen: But I didn't win.
Tex: Lightnin', there's a whole lot more to racin' than just winnin'.
Rust-eze Van: He was so rusty, when he drove down the street. Hahaha. Buzzards used to circle the car!
Folks: Hahahaha.
McQueen: Thank, you, Mr. Tex, but...but these Rust-eze guys over there gave me my big break. I'm gonna stick with them.
Tex: Well, I sure can respect that. Still, you know, if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.
McQueen: I sure appreciate that. Thank you. Actually, there is one thing.
Mater: Whoah! Hoo! Aaaa! Hey look at me! I'm flyin', by golly! Whoahh! Hoo! I'm happier than a tornado in a trailer park!
Luigi: I think it's about-a time we redecorate.
Michael Schumacker: Chow! Hi, Lightning McQueen told me this was the best place in the world to get tires. How 'bout setting me and my friends up with three or four sets each?
Luigi: Huh. Guido! There is a real Michael Schumacker Ferrari in my store. A real Ferrari! Punch me, Guido. Punch me in the face. This is the most glorious day of my life.
Michael Schumacker: Wow. Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda. Mi dicono che siete fantastici.
Sally: Uh..huh!. Hahaha. Just passin' through?
McQueen: Actually, I thought I'd stop and stay awhile. I hear this place is back on the map.
Sally: It is?
McQueen: Yeah, there's some rumor floating around that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar is setting up his big racing headquarters here.
Sally: Really? Well, there goes the town.
McQueen: You know, I really missed you, Sally.
Sally: Well, I create feelings in others they themselves don't understand and, blah, blah, blah,  blah.
McQueen: Hahaha.
Mater: McQueen and Sally parked beneath the tree, K-i-s-s...i-n-t!
McQueen: Great timing, Mater!
Mater: Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Weeeee!!
McQueen: He's my best friend. What're you gonna do?
Sally: So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?
McQueen: I don't know. Why don't we just take a drive?
Sally: Mmm. Nahh.
McQueen: Yeah! Ka-chow!
Mater: Yeeeehoooo!!!!!</p>
